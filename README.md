# REST API Strict Origin

Limits `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for REST API access to only allowed origins by `is_allowed_http_origin()`. By default this includes the home and site URLs.

## Installation

If you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage dependencies, you can use the following command to add the plugin to your site:

```bash
composer require wearerequired/rest-api-same-origin
```
